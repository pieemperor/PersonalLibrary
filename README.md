# PersonalLibrary

This was my second project in my Data Structures class. The purpose of this project
was to develop an application that keeps track of a personal library and manage GUI windows that
allow the user to view the information about each library. 

You can upload | delimited files with all the attributes of different books to import a library. 
An example text file is included in the project. This program also tracks the owner of the library, and you 
can make changes to that information.

This project taught me how to create Windows Forms applications, and it also taught me how to override operators
and create indexers in C# that would allow you to access certain data from the class.
